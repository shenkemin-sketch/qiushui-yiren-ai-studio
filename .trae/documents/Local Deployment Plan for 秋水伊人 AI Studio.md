This project is a React application built with Vite. I will deploy it locally by following these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all necessary packages defined in `package.json`.
2.  **Start Development Server**: Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server.
3.  **Open Application**: Provide you with the local URL to open the application in your browser.

I will execute these commands for you.
